In this project I have made Youtube Application Clone. There is a main application page in which I have used Goodle's Api
to fetch 50 youtube trending videos in India region and when you click one of them you get to route to a 
video page where I have embedded that video from youtube. I have made a comment section down the video. 
After a while Ive made a live chat section there too... 

Two of the very good features according to in this project are, firstly, the search bar, in which I used again Youtube's 
API for search suggestions... So whats special is the debouncing it does and the caching of search results which makes it 
a well organized, well optimized search. Secondly, is the live chat, in which i have used a api for randdom names generated 
and random messages it puts.

One of a really cool feature is, I it has an nesting comments unlike youtube. One example of this nested comments is 
Reddit. For this I have used nested Components concept to nest the replies on the comments below the youtube video in 
Video page...


# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
